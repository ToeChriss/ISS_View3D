Project Summary
------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the project is to track the 3D view of the International Space Station (ISS) in a web interface using opens source technologies based on the already existing 2D view off the ISS.
We have found it to make it more funny interactive and educational view for anyone in the web browser. At the end the project should show information about the area covered.

Technology used
-------------------------------------
-3D Modeling
For 3D modeling we used [Blender3D release 2.74](www.blender.org)

-3D export 
For 3D export we have used [Blend4web release 15.03] (www.blend4web.com) 

-Web
We create a web page that embed ressources generated from blender (.JSON and HTML)

What comes next?

We are planning to develop a mobile android app. We are looking forward to enhance interactivity and ease page loading.
